This projet is a tiny project, that i will make to improve my SFML librairy conprehension and logic for futures projects.

## What have been done ? 

The class diagram and it's structure have been made (only SFML is to improve for optimisation)

The logic game with the Game and the Grid class is implemented and won't change in the future.

## What's next to do ? 

Add better SFML visualisation : 
- Draw a line in the SFML Grid when someone win
- Add a restart button
- SFML optimisation
